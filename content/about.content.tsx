          I&apos;m good at <HighlightText>recognizing patterns</HighlightText>. I can identify cues to improve my
          behavior, but I can also synthesize knowledge to communicate it more effectively. <br />

          I seek the <HighlightText>validation</HighlightText> of friends and strangers more than I wished. It makes{" "}
          <HighlightText>anxious</HighlightText> at social settings like clubs or concerts. <br />
          <br />
          On top of that, <HighlightText>I cannot enjoy an activity I cannot be really good at</HighlightText>. You
          might say everybody is like that, but my friends have no problem losing against me over and over (haha).

          and that refusing to pay it is what holds us back the most.
          <br />
          <br />I also believe we constantly <HighlightText>escape reality</HighlightText> through our vices because we
          don&apos;t know a better way to cope with the anxiety that we have{" "}

          Vasectomy doesn&apos;t mean no children, it means no children with my DNA on them,{" "}
