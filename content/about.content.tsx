          I&apos;m good at <HighlightText>recognizing patterns</HighlightText>. I can identify cues to improve my
          behavior, but I can also synthesize knowledge to communicate it more effectively. <br />
          <br /> Recognizing patterns also applies to decision-making, allowing me to be{" "}
          <HighlightText>practical</HighlightText> but also very <HighlightText>optimistic</HighlightText> in life.

          I seek the <HighlightText>validation</HighlightText> of friends and strangers more than I wished. It makes{" "}
          <HighlightText>anxious</HighlightText> at social settings like clubs or concerts. <br />
          <br />
          On top of that, <HighlightText>I cannot enjoy an activity I cannot be really good at</HighlightText>. You
          might say everybody is like that, but my friends have no problem losing against me over and over (haha).

          I believe that our <HighlightText>dreams and desires have a price</HighlightText>, not necessarily monetary,
          and that refusing to pay for them is what holds us back the most.
          <br />
          <br />I also believe we constantly <HighlightText>escape reality</HighlightText> through our vices because we
          don&apos;t know a better way to deal with the anxiety that we have{" "}
          <HighlightText>failed to address and integrate</HighlightText> into our lives.

          Yes. To avoid an <HighlightText>unintended pregnancy</HighlightText> and so that my partner can stop taking

          <br />
          Vasectomy doesn&apos;t mean no children, it means no children with my DNA on them,{" "}
